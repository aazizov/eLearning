00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,003
- [Speaker] Dropdown menus allow users to select one

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,000
or more options from a list

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,006
and are typically represented by the select element

4
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:13,003
that contains one or more option elements to choose from.

5
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:16,006
Let's explore how to use Web Driver to interact

6
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,007
with select elements.

7
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:22,001
While Web Driver provides generic methods to interact

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,004
with standalone web elements, dropdown menus consist

9
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:28,005
of both select and option elements.

10
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,002
This unique component requires specialized handling,

11
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:36,000
and fortunately, we can use Selenium's select class,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,008
which provides methods specifically for interacting

13
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,007
with dropdown menus.

14
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,006
We'd find the select element, just as we would

15
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:52,007
with any other element, so let's say driver.findeEement,

16
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:56,003
and we can say By.name,

17
00:00:56,003 --> 00:01:00,008
and the name of that dropdown is my-select,

18
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:05,003
but then we substantiate a select object with this element.

19
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:10,006
So let's use our select class and we'll call this dropdown

20
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:13,000
and we'll say, this equals a new,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,001
and we'll call the select constructor

22
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:20,001
and pass in this driver.findElement.

23
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,009
Select provides multiple ways

24
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,005
to select an option from the dropdown menu.

25
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:28,001
The best approach is to select the option by its value

26
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,003
because the value is less likely to change

27
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,007
compared to other approaches.

28
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,008
To do so, we'd say

29
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:41,000
dropdown.select by value,

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,003
and we can put in the value as two,

31
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:50,002
which will select this option from the dropdown menu.

32
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:52,003
Another approach is to select the option

33
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:54,007
by what's displayed on the webpage.

34
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:57,009
Let's select the option that says three,

35
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,007
which we see here in the dropdown menu.

36
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:07,002
We'll say dropdown.selectByVisibleText,

37
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:12,003
and we can put in the text there, which was three.

38
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:15,004
Selecting by index is another alternative,

39
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,007
though it's less reliable

40
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:19,004
because the index may change if the order

41
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:21,005
of options is modified.

42
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,000
I typically use this approach when I don't necessarily care

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,008
what I'm selecting,

44
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,008
but I just want to select the first option for example.

45
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:31,003
The index starts at zero,

46
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:35,001
which is the label element, so let's choose index one

47
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,003
to select the first real option.

48
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:42,001
To do so, we say dropdown.selectByIndex

49
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,002
and enter the index.

50
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,006
The select class also provides a couple of methods

51
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:51,003
to retrieve the selected options from a dropdown.

52
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,008
To get the first option that's selected,

53
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:56,000
we can say webElement,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,006
and let's call this one selectedOption

55
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:06,007
and we'll say dropdown.getFirstSelectedOption.

56
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,004
And if we wanted to get all

57
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:12,002
of the selected options from a multi-select dropdown,

58
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:18,006
we could do List of WebElements.

59
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:23,008
We'll call this one selectedOptions,

60
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,005
and we can say dropdown.getAllSelectedOptions.

61
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:31,006
For multi-select dropdowns.

62
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:34,009
The select class provides similar methods to allow you

63
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,001
to deselect options.

64
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:48,003
We can deselect by value by saying dropdown.deselectByValue,

65
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:53,008
and enter the value there, two for example,

66
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:55,002
we can also deselect

67
00:03:55,002 --> 00:04:02,003
by visible text by saying dropdown.deselectByVisibleText

68
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:08,008
and entering the text from the dropdown to one, for example.

69
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:12,005
And we can also deselect by index,

70
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:16,007
dropdown.deselectByIndex

71
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:20,004
and enter the index of the option to deselect,

72
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:22,009
one for example, note

73
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,008
that these methods will throw an exception

74
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:27,006
if used on a single select dropdown

75
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:31,001
because the deselect functionality is not possible

76
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,007
for that type of dropdown.

77
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:38,002
Instead, you can select an option that represents the empty

78
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,008
or default value.

79
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:42,008
In this case, it would be open this select menu.

80
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:45,009
This is often the first option in the dropdown,

81
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,009
typically used as a prompt or a placeholder.

82
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,002
By selecting this option,

83
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:56,000
you effectively deselect any previously selected options.
