- [Instructor] Checkboxes can be selected

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,007
or deselected simply by clicking them.

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:09,000
However, you should check the state of a checkbox

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
before calling the click method

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so that you don't inadvertently take the opposite action.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
For example, if your goal is to check this checkbox,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,004
but it's already checked, when you call the click method,

8
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:24,008
it will uncheck the element.

9
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:28,004
Let's explore how to properly interact with checkboxes

10
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,006
with Web Driver.

11
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,007
Let's first create a web element object

12
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:34,000
representing the checkbox.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we'll say

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,006
WebElement checkbox =

15
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:57,003
driver.findElement(By.id("my-check-1")).

16
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,002
Web Driver provides an is selected method

17
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,007
that returns true if the element is selected

18
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,005
and false if not.

19
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:06,001
Let's call that method.

20
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:16,003
So we'll say boolean isSelected = checkbox.isSelected().

21
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,002
Now we'll use an if statement

22
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:21,002
to determine if the checkbox needs to be clicked

23
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,009
in order to meet our objective.

24
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:32,007
So we'll say, if(!isSelected), meaning the checkbox

25
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,005
is not checked,

26
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:40,008
then we'll go ahead and click the checkbox to select it.

27
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,006
Now your code will only click the checkbox

28
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:47,000
if it's not already selected.
