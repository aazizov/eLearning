00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,002
- [Instructor] WebDriver is not only used

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,005
to locate elements,

3
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:06,003
but more importantly, to interact with them.

4
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,006
Let's look at this text box.

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:11,009
WebDriver offers methods to read, write,

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,003
and clear a text box.

7
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:18,005
Let's do each of those with Selenium WebDriver.

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,000
We can locate this element by its name,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,007
so let's say WebElement textbox =

10
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:33,004
driver.findElement(By.name),

11
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:40,008
and its name was "id-name1".

12
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,004
Then to read the value of this element,

13
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:49,006
we say textbox.getText(),

14
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,009
and this will return the string of the text

15
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,002
that's inside of that text box.

16
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,005
To remove the text that's in the field,

17
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:03,002
we call textbox.clear().

18
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:05,008
And to set text in the textbox,

19
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:11,000
we say textbox.sendKeys,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,009
and then we provide the text to write.

21
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:17,009
So I'm going to put my name, feel free to put yours.

22
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,003
I'm going to comment out this quit() command

23
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:24,006
so that we can see what happens when we run this.

24
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,005
So we'll click Run,

25
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:31,002
and switch over to our browser tab.

26
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:34,008
And notice here, you see "angie" was written

27
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:37,000
to that text box.
