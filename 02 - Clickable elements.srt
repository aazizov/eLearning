- [Instructor] Let's explore how to use WebDriver

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:06,007
to click web elements such as buttons and links.

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,006
This button doesn't have an ID,

4
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,001
but we can use an XPath query

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:17,000
composed of the element's type and inner text.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,002
To find the element, we'll say: driver.findElement,

7
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:26,009
and then we'll say By.xpath.

8
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:31,002
In the XPath, we'll use two forward slashes

9
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:33,003
to start from the root.

10
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,004
We'll specify the element's type as button,

11
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:40,001
and we'll say call the text() function on that,

12
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,009
and make sure that it returns "Submit".

13
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:48,002
Then from here we can say .click().

14
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:52,000
We can use this same technique to click this link.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,009
The extra spacing here could prove problematic,

16
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:00,009
but we can take care of that within an XPath selector.

17
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:09,003
So we'll say driver.findElement By.xpath,

18
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,005
and we'll start with the a element,

19
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:17,008
and we'll call a function named normalize-space,

20
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:20,005
and we'll call text() inside of that,

21
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:24,002
and then we'll set this equal to the text of the link,

22
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:28,009
which was "Return to index".

23
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,002
From here, we can call .click(),

24
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,004
and that will click the link.

25
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,000
In addition to buttons and links,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,009
there are other types of elements that must be clicked

27
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,008
in order to interact with them.

28
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:44,009
For example, to choose a color from this color picker,

29
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,001
we'd need to first click the element,

30
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,007
same for the date picker,

31
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:56,000
and same for these radio buttons as well.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,009
Fortunately, the strategy does not change.

33
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,009
Locate the element with the best locator strategy available,

34
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,000
then use that web element to call the click() method.
